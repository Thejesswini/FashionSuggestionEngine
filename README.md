This project involves a Fashion Suggestion Engine wherein users are able to give both text and image input queries, and relevant results from the lancedb vector database are returned.
Upon clicking one of those results, the engine performs a reverse image search and directly provides links to ecommerce sites where the user can purchase their preferred product.

shared_vector_fill.ipynb can be adapted to fill your own data into the vector database
The images and vector database can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dIOiUaspMHb9vKJ5ts--xZGuAK2igtvl?usp=drive_link
